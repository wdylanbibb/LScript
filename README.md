# LScript
A custom interpreted language, written in Java.

LScript is a primarily statically-typed scripting language, with the ability to use dynamic typing in most cases, as well.
It is written fully in Java.


To run the language in command line, compile all of the classes provided. The Main method is located in Basic/src/main/java/jav/lscript.Shell.java.

The interpreter can be run without any arguments, which will result in a command line version of the language; 
It can also be provided the path to a file, which it will subsequently process and run.

This language is based off of the tutorial series by CodePulse on Youtube titled "Create Your Own Programming Language," 
with different syntax choices, capabilities, and quirks, as well as converted from Python to Java.
